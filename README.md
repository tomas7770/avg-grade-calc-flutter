# Average Grade Calculator (Flutter)

Simple app for calculating the weighted average of grades. Does pretty much the same thing as [this one](https://github.com/tomas7770/avg-grade-calc), but uses Flutter instead of wxWidgets, and targets mobile platforms instead of desktop.

## Build instructions (Android)

Just follow the [instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on Flutter's docs to setup a working development environment and build an Android app. Using **Android Studio** is recommended, since the app was developed using it.
